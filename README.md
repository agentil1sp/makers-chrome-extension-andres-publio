## üìÇ Proyect Roadmap

**1.** Built the chrome extension with its interface.

**2.** Connected the chatgpt api to the chrome extension.

**3.** We built the api with the methods to display the hostorial and the method to store the questions and answers to chatGPT.

**4.** Integrated the api code into the chrome extension.

## üíª How to use the chrome extension on your computer
- Make a git clone of this repository
- Go to [OpenIA](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) enter the apikey section and generate an apikey.
- Go to the keys.js file and paste the apikey inside the quotes.
- Go to the chrome extensions page chrome://extensions and hit enable developer mode in the upper right corner.
- In the upper right corner click on load unpacked extension.
- Find the folder you got from the repository and select it.
- Click the extensions icon in the browser and pin the extension.
- Tap the extension and you are ready to use it.

## ü§ñ Code improvements
- I would put the files in folders, for example popup files.
- I would create a login because currently when you hit the history button you see the history of all the people who have used the extension, although I like it the way it is because you give people the opportunity to see what questions other people ask.
- In the api I would create a structure of controllers and routas, maybe it is not necessary because it only has two functionalities but I would do it anyway.
- I would add more styles to the history window.
- I would have the history sorted by newest to oldest request.
- I would change the style and size of the extension interface.
- I would put a functionality for people to set the apikey from the extension interface.
